    <h1>Thinking AI</h1>
    <p>This is a placeholder webpage to announce the start of what will hopefully be a rewarding, productive and community-led initiative of the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments">Faculty of Arts and Humanities</a> at University of Southampton.</p>

    <p>The site is aimed at staff and students of the Faculty – to provide a context for learning, sharing and research, including the development of a <a href="#graph">shared knowledge base</a>. The site is also public, to encourage a community of practice and to document a live, ongoing exploration of the growing significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Higher Education sector, across all activities of research, education, enterprise and infrastructure.</p>
    <p><strong>For further details</strong> and/or to share thoughts, email: <a href="mailto:s.manghani@soton.ac.uk">Prof. Sunil Manghani</a> (Faculty AI Champion).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>AI@Southampton</h2>
    <p>The project aligns with and will help inform <a href="https://sotonac.sharepoint.com/teams/AISouthampton/SitePages/What-is-AI-@-Southampton-.aspx">AI@Southampton</a> – an online space led by the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/web-science-institute">Web Science Institute</a>, established for faculties and other groups to come together, collaborate, and share work that involves artificial intelligence as part of their research.</p>

    <p>Interdisciplinary AI is a University strategic priority, along with data in society, platform governance, social trust, democratic innovation, technological sustainability and other AI-related topics that form WSI’s unique socio-technical remit. It is vital that multiple perspectives from within and across the arts and humanities have a stake in what comes next…</p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>Faculty-wide and University-facing. A collaborative initiative to engage critically with artificial intelligence within the domains of education, research, and enterprise, as well as educational administration and infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Underpinned by a commitment to Responsible AI—not just in the immediate ethical sense, but in terms of institutional responsibility for shaping AI’s future role in higher education.</p>

    <p><strong>NB:</strong> The phrase ‘Thinking AI’ is intended to recall Victor Burgin's <em>Thinking Photography</em> (1982), which sought to establish a theoretical account of photography beyond aesthetic appreciation or technical documentation. Burgin recognized that despite photography's century-long history, a coherent theoretical framework remained underdeveloped. Today, AI might suggest a comparable, if not heightened ‘critical juncture’.</p>

    <p>Current discussions largely oscillate between technical specifications on one hand, and ethical concerns on the other. What is missing is a rigorous analysis of AI as a socio-material set of practices and contestations. The topic of AI needs sensitivity and openness, as much as it warrants the richness of critical debate and practical exploration.</p>

        <h2>Knowledge Base</h2>
        
        <p>The pace of development in AI research and implementation is currenlty rapid and, at times, overwhelming. With a view to supporting a community of practice and enhancing capability across the Faculty, a <strong>Knowledge Base</strong> will be developed, alongside testing various ways of sharing ideas, facilitating dialogue, and supporting research and education.</p> 
        <p>The knowledge graph below is a (hastily prepared) prototype. It maps AI-related research outputs from the University’s <a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk">ePrints</a> repository. It will be refined in due course and further tools will be considered to help capture and connect emerging work across disciplines.</p>
